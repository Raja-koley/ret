1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-page.git
    How It Works- The login form collects a username and password.
- On submission, JavaScript checks if the fields are filled.
- It then compares the input to a hardcoded username/password pair.
- If matched, it displays a success message or redirects to a "dashboard" page.
- If not, it shows an error message.
